Here I describe the streamline for the deuterated gas-grain modeling.

1. Reduce the size of the RATE06 gas phase network.
    1.1. Some tests may be needed.

2. Generate the deuterated network.
    2.1 Some tests may be needed.

3. Combine it with the ``driving'' deuteration network (taken from Roberts+).
    3.1 Some tests may be needed.

4. Combine it with the surface network.

5. Run the code.
