Here I describe the streamline for the deuterated gas-grain modeling.

1. Reduce the size of the RATE06 gas phase network.
- Some tests may be needed.

2. Generate the deuterated network.
- Some tests may be needed.

3. Combine it with the ``driving'' deuteration network (taken from Roberts+).
- Some tests may be needed.

4. Combine it with the surface network.

5. Run the code.
